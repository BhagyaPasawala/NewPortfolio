                        <p>One of my friend's brother met with an unfortunate incident in Toronto due to lack of
                            personal transportation and security. And I started thinking about the problem and it 
                            really touched me. I immediately started working on it.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Protech is a personal security app which everyone deserves. If user feels that he/she is
                            in danger, they can just press a button on the app and everyone nearby with the app within the specific
                            range, will get notified that someone near is in danger so that they have an 
                            option to save them or alert everyone around. This app doesn't solve the problem entirely but 
                            it minimizes the risk. <br /><br />We all dreamt about being a super hero as a child, now this app is giving 
                            you a chance to actually be one.

                        <h1>➸Process</h1>
                        <p> Defined problem statement, hypothesis, user research, competitive analysis, information architecture, 
                            branding elements then later on designed low, medium and high fidelity. Then came up with the MVP and 
                            did some testing. Made some improvements and now will start developing the app using React Native.
