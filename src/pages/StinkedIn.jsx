                        <p> StinkedIn is the anti-networking platform you never knew you needed!
                            A parody of the corporate social network. Instead of showing off polished r√©sum√©s and
                            endless success stories, here you can embrace your inner chaos and laugh at the struggles
                            of the modern job hunt. Whether you're a sleep-deprived coder, an overworked intern, or just
                            tired of ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù, StinkedIn is your space to vent, joke, and connect with others who
                            understand that sometimes.. things just stink! üòÑ
                            </p>
                        <h1>‚û∏Process</h1>
                        <p> Built using ReactJs, for now this is just a front-end UI project, but I am
                            working on its backend so that anyone can post anything they want. Working on this 
                            project was super tricky as I was learning props. Now I am going to implement messaging feature 
                            and fake job portal too.
                            <br />

                            The purpose of StinkedIn is
                            to practice and showcase my coding skills, and no infringement is intended.
