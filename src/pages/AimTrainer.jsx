                        <p>I used to be a competitive CsGo player and we had to train our aims and I always wanted my own little
                            aim trainer where I can practice. So here it is.
                            </p>
                        <h1>➸Process</h1>
                        <p> You know the app is fun when you spend more time using it while building it. 
                            That's what happened, even though it was fun but it was pretty complicated in the 
                            beginning while learning about the react states and how they work. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            But later on when the initial logic worked and I understood it, I spent some time playing the game lol. And then
                            later on fixed the design, the blinking of the object, added a scoring system and the timer. 
                            </p>
